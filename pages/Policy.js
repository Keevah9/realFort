          We can ship to virtually any address in the world. Note that there are
          restrictions on some products, and some products cannot be shipped to
          international destinations. When you place an order, we will estimate
          shipping and delivery dates for you based on the availability of your
          items and the shipping options you choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the shipping provider you choose, shipping date estimates
          may appear on the shipping quotes page. Please also note that the
          shipping rates for many items we sell are weight-based. The weight of
          any such item can be found on its detail page. To reflect the policies
          of the shipping companies we use, all weights will be rounded up to
          the next full pound.
